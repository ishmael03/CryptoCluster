# Cryptocurrency Clustering Project

### Project Overview
This project is designed to cluster cryptocurrencies using various factors, including market capitalization, price, volume, and social media sentiment. By leveraging data directly from CoinMarketCap's API, we aim to apply and test clustering algorithms to uncover underlying patterns in the cryptocurrency market.

### Objective
The primary objective is to utilize CoinMarketCap's API to explore and validate the effectiveness of clustering algorithms in grouping cryptocurrencies based on their market behavior and social sentiment indicators.

### Dataset
The analysis is based on a dataset retrieved from CoinMarketCap's API, encompassing price, volume, supply, and price percent change across different time frames for the top 5,000 coins in the market.

### Execution
To run the analysis, open the Cluster Cryptocurrency.ipynb notebook in a Jupyter environment and execute the cells sequentially.

### Models Evaluated
K-Means Clustering: A pivotal part of the analysis, exploring the segmentation of cryptocurrencies to identify patterns and market dynamics.

### Results
The analysis revealed expected outcomes, with Bitcoin and Ethereum dominating the market in terms of market cap and volume. This dominance is reflective in their clustering, underscoring their pivotal role in market movements.

### Future Work
* Exploration of Advanced Models: Delving into more sophisticated clustering techniques to refine our understanding of market segmentation.
* Incorporation of Additional Metrics: Enhancing the dataset with more diverse metrics to provide a more comprehensive view of the cryptocurrency market.
